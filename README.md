# Buzzer-System
The way that academic competitions work is this: to get points, a player must "buzz in" while or after a question has been answered. Then, the player must answer the question correctly. The moderator will take whoever buzzes in first, so it is very important to practice the buzzing motion to do well. My team has lots of talent, but we are always at a disadvantage when we go to competitions becausewe never practice with the equipment that we use at those competions. Usually at practices, to buzz in, we just hit the desk, while at competions there is a handheld buzzer system where the button to buzz in must be activated by a thumb motion. Naturally, we are slightly outperformed in this category by teams that do practice with a real buzzer system. 
The solution is simple: just buy a buzzer system like the ones at the competitions. 
However, decent quality buzzer systems are expensive. Some of the highest quality systems are $200-$300, and my school simply cannot afford something like that. Given that, I decided to make a buzzer system for us.
Not only does having a buzzer system help the team practice better, but if we bring our own buzzer system to a competition, we get a discount on the entry fee.
Here is the finished system:
